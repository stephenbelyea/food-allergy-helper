# Food Allergy Helper

Read (or manually enter) barcodes on food products to get a quick view of common allergens.

Uses the [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org) database and API service to lookup and retrieve food information. Because we're only using the `GET` endpoint(s), there is no user or authentication required.

## How to use this?

Pull down and install the repo. This requires Git, Node, NPM, and a terminal application (like [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)).

### Install

```
cd food-allery-helper
npm install
```

### Run locally

```
npm start
```
